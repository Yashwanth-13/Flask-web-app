# A Flask web-app

This project is a web-application built using Flask which is a powerful python framework, just like Django, but in a simplified manner.

For the web-site to run, sqlite3 database engine and sqlite3 library for Python is used to keep hold of the user data.

Ofcourse, there are many changes that can be made in this website (for starters, not storing the user data in plain-text..!), but this is just to demonstrate a part of which Flask can do.

The website was previously run on *vercel* but later shifted it to *pythonanywhere by Anaconda*
